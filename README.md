# Posix Implementations

This repo is meant to serve as a comparison of various languages in doing relatively simple real-world tasks, by implementing in each language, the ["POSIX" standard utilities](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799.2018edition/)

The goal is to have a modern maintained implementation of each utility, for each popular programming language (if practical!)

## Languages

* Nim : ./nimix
* Zig : ./pozig
* Your favorite language! (we welcome contributions!)
